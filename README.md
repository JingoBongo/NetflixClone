all labs in one


I tried to follow MVP pattern, but there are way too many variations in the web.
Mostly this lead me to dividing everything into views/logic functionality/ models(object classes, dto)

Not sure if everything would fit into your understanding of this pattern, but hopefully, at least a part

Anyway. Request calls/activities/models are divided (mostly logically. you wrote that file structure doesn't matter tht much)

This lab has enough requests(even post with data in body), has a couple of lists/recyclerviews, landscape aview versions where I wanted, ability to play video + about 5 screens
(genres, search, help, movie list, single movie screen.. does fullscreen movie count as 6th?)

Since all data is given by the server, and my server was on my laptop, you can't check major part of functionality. (Unless you ask me
to upload a server with 5+gigs of videos, database and pictures). This is why I also uploaded here a screen record 
( https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VKTj7R7-ua7SwMLpWD51GRcagks9VZCV ).

P.S. sorry for being late. I realized that deep learning thing would take me much more time so I moved to a lighter project goal
